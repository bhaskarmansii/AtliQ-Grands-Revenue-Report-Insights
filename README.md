# AtliQ-Grands-Revenue-Report-Insights

 Through this project case study of AtliQ Grands, a fictional company operating in the hospitality industry, I explored revenue optimization strategies and gained valuable insights to help AtliQ Grands improve their market share and revenue performance in the luxury/business hotels category.

**Problem Statement**

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the MD of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights. This is part of the Resume challenge organized by Codebasics.io

**Insights and Recommendation**

**Pricing Strategy Optimization:** The current flat pricing approach is limiting revenue potential. Our analysis indicates a lack of dynamic pricing, with the Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR) remaining static.

**Opportunity in Dynamic Pricing:** We've identified a promising avenue for AtliQ Grands in adopting dynamic pricing for different hotel segments. Tailoring pricing strategies based on weekday/weekend trends and factors affecting occupancy could significantly enhance profitability.

**Hotel Performance and Guest Ratings:** Correlation between occupancy rate and average ratings becomes apparent. Low-rated hotels have lower occupancy. This prompts us to explore whether low ratings stem from online presence or service issues.

**Online Visibility:** In an era where consumers heavily rely on online platforms for hotel selection, consistently updating content across various platforms is pivotal. This enhances the chances of attracting potential customers by offering a comprehensive view of their offerings.
